# Linux_Server_Configuration
for Udacity Fullstack Web Development Project

This project is my Item-Catalog project, Virtual Vending Machine, loaded onto a leLinux Apache2 server through Amazon Web Service's Lightsail. The project is meant to mimic a vending machine with various items available to read (or create, edit and delete after login with either Google or Facebook).
